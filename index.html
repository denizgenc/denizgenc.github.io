<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
<p> If you want to find out what I'm working on and learning about, you've come
to the right place!</p>
<p> This is the first commit that I'm making to my website, so please excuse the
bareness. In the mean time, check out some of these links:
<ul>
    <li>My GitHub profile, <a href="https://www.github.com/denizgenc">denizgenc,</a>
    with all my repos</li>
    <li>I drew inspiration for this site <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">
    from here</a> &mdash; which means I lifted some of the source and CSS from it,
    with my own modifications of course</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cryptopals</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptopals.com">Cryptopals</a> is an online coding
challenge with the aim of teaching people that the basics of cryptography.
<a href="https://github.com/denizgenc/cryptopals/">My repo</a> contains my attempts
at solving the set of problems.</p>
<h3>brief-karate-set</h3>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546390/Brief_Karate_Foolish/">Brief
Karate Foolish</a> is an independently produced fighting game, released on Steam
for PC in November 2016. The game did not have a button configuration menu in
game, which caused headaches for people (like me) that wanted to use their
controllers instead. I decided to fix the issue, and so the repo
<a href="https://github.com/denizgenc/brief-karate-set">brief-karate-set</a>
was born.</p>
<p>To do this I needed to discover and learn a Python library that would allow me
to interface with joysticks. I eventually settled on <a href="https://www.pygame.org">
Pygame</a>, and I ended up with a script that did do some automation. This was
also my first experience merging a pull request on one of my own repositories!
There's still a lot to be desired (for example it does not have a GUI), and I
plan to improve it a bit more in the future.</p>
