<h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
<p> If you want to find out what I'm working on and learning about, you've come
to the right place!</p>
<p> This is the first commit that I'm making to my website, so please excuse the
bareness. In the mean time, check out some of these links:
<ul>
    <li>My GitHub profile, <a href="https://www.github.com/denizgenc">denizgenc,</a>
    with all my repos</li>
    <li>I drew inspiration for this site <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">
    from here</a> &mdash; which means I lifted some of the source and CSS from it,
    with my own modifications of course</li>
</ul>
