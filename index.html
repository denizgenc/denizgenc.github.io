<h3>Cryptopals</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptopals.com">Cryptopals</a> is an online coding
challenge with the aim of teaching people the basics of cryptography.
<a href="https://github.com/denizgenc/cryptopals/">My repo</a> contains my attempts
at solving the set of problems.</p>
<h3>encryption-fun</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/denizgenc/encryption_fun">This repo</a> contains a
Python script (<code>rotemake.py</code>) that takes an input file, and it into a
"ROT file", a type of (what I believe is) a one-time pad. The specification for
the ROT file type is provided in the file <code>ROT file spec.txt</code>.</p>
<h3>brief-karate-set</h3>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546390/Brief_Karate_Foolish/">Brief
Karate Foolish</a> is an independently produced fighting game, released on Steam
for PC in November 2016. The game did not have a button configuration menu in
game, which caused headaches for people (like me) that wanted to use their
controllers instead. I decided to fix the issue, and so the repo
<a href="https://github.com/denizgenc/brief-karate-set">brief-karate-set</a>
was born.</p>
<p>To do this I needed to discover and learn a Python library that would allow me
to interface with joysticks. I eventually settled on <a href="https://www.pygame.org">
Pygame</a>, and I ended up with a script that did do some automation. This was
also my first experience merging a pull request on one of my own repositories!
There's still a lot to be desired (for example it does not have a GUI), and I
plan to improve it a bit more in the future.</p>
<h3>treepy</h3>
<p>This repository is relatively basic - I wanted to make a clone of the
<code>tree</code> program that's available on Windows, in Python. The reason for
this is that I have a pretty large music collection on my desktop PC that I want
to keep synchronised with my phone, and instead of using a somewhat sane solution
like cloud storage I just locally copy files over, use <code>python treepy.py</code>
on both my desktop and my phone, then <code>diff</code> the outputted
<code>TREE.TXT</code> file to see what differences there are.</p>
<p>Definitely not an optimal solution, but I made it. So I use it occasionally.</p>
<p>One feature of this script is that it looks for a file called
<code>EXCLUDE.TXT</code>, which tells the script to exclude certain files/folders
from the output, so only the folders I <em>want</em> to compare get output to the
tree.</p>
