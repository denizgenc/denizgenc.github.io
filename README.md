# denizgenc.github.io

This repository contains all the files used to host my website, found at
<https://denizgenc.co.uk>.

Since it's hosted by GitHub Pages, I've added some minimal Jekyll configuration, in order to a)
replicate the page locally and b) get things to look consistent without too much effort. Namely:
- For local dev, I've created a `Gemfile` and a `_config.yml`
- For nice rendering, a single `_layout/default.html` file.

The aim is to be as technology-agnostic as possible, so this should be enough.
